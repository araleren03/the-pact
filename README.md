# The Pact (Local: Hodri) 🤝

A "Skin in the Game" social challenge network built with a Single Codebase & Dual Identity architecture. 

Unlike standard habit trackers, The Pact forces users to put their reputation or stakes on the line. It features a unique "Call the Bluff" mechanism, allowing friends across different timezones to challenge each other, verify habits, and build discipline through social accountability.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dual Identity Architecture (ASO):** Dynamically shifts UI and branding based on device locale. Functions as **"Hodri"** in Turkey and **"The Pact"** globally, running on a single unified backend.
* **The "Bluff" Mechanism:** Zero-friction tracking. Users simply claim they completed a task. The opponent can either accept it or "Call the Bluff," triggering a 24-hour mandatory photo-proof request.
* **Cross-Border Pacts:** Designed to handle international challenges (e.g., Turkey to Mexico) with seamless timezone synchronization.
* **Smart Verification (Upcoming):** Modular architecture ready for Geofencing (GPS) and Health API (Google Fit/Apple Health) integrations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend (Mobile):**
* React Native (Expo)
* TypeScript
* Multi-language support (i18n) & Dynamic Theming

**Backend (API & Database):**
* Java (Spring Boot)
* PostgreSQL
